Another Merco's syndrom near Maison blanche ?

Cars driving on Ancien moulin

Draw great wheel (turning & lightning, maybe with LOD model), Nolok Experience Center (Porsche), maybe replacing Tires_Pits, AmandArena, Airport with flying planes, multiple houses
Add laughs sound near great wheel
Make cars klaxon on approach

Chemin aux boeufs entrance : put some movable barriers to hide the shortcut
“Village“ after Chemin aux boeufs/Bugatti raccord

Add multiple publicities, for example on Ancien-moulin's bridge and barriers.
